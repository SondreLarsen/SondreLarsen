## 📢About me
Hello! My name is Sondre Bech-Larsen and I come from Norway🇳🇴. I have been coding since about 2023 where i have been doing mostly python, HTML, and CSS. In my free time(outside of programming) I have played handball on my local team since 2018🤾‍♂️, I play guitar which i have been doing since 2019🎸, I am also really into STEM like science and math and stuff so sometimes I like to test myself on complex math equasions or research a branch in physics I am not to familiar with or sometimes a completly new one💡, I also have a homelab where i just play with some old computers I found💻.

## 🗣Language
I am fluent in both norwegian🇳🇴 and english🇬🇧, and I am currently learning spanish🇪🇸 in school. Earlier I have learned a teeny tiny bit of japanese🇯🇵 by the green owl🦉

## 👨‍💻Programming languages
I started learning python in 2023 where i mostly played with the turtle library🐢 But I have also done some small stuff with pygame and I currently prefer to make text based games aka no graphical interface just text kinda like a choose your own adventure type of book. Not long after I started programming I really wanted to make a website so i started to learn HTML and eventually CSS to make those websites look better, never got to learning javascript tho, but I am planning on doing so soon.

## 💻Homelabbing
After coding for a while I got interested in how computers work so I got into homelabbing. My homelab started as a pc I found on facebook marketplace which I turned into a NAS by switching the OS to ubuntu server and installing a few HDDs into it. I eventually built further on it by finding a few old laptops in my basement and turning the newest one into a media server using jellyfin, I used one of the older ones with a dvd player to get the media files from a dvd collection my family has.
