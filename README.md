## 📢About me
I come from Norway(emoji) I have been coding since about 2023 where i have been doing mostly python, html, and css. In my free time(outside of programming) I play handball on my local team since 2018, I play guitar which i have been doing since 2019, I am really into STEM like science and math and stuff so sometimes I like to test myself on complex math equasions, I also have a homelab where i just play with some old computers i found.

## 🗣Languages
I am fluent in both norwegian and english, and I am currently learning spanish in school. Earlier I have learned a teeny tiny bit of japanese by the green owl🦉

## 👨‍💻Programming languages
I started learning python in 2023 where i mostly played with the turtle library🐢 But I have also done some small stuff with pygame and I currently prefer to make text based games aka no graphical interface just text kinda like a choose your own adventure type of book. Not long after I started programming I really wanted to make a website so i started to learn HTML and eventually CSS to make those websites look better, never got to learning javascript tho, but I am planning on doing so soon.

## 💻Homelabbing
After coding for a while I got interested in how computers work so I got into homelabbing. My homelab started as a pc I found on facebook marketplace which I turned into a NAS by switching the OS to ubuntu server and installing a few HDDs into it. I eventually built further on it by finding a few old laptops in my basement and turning the newest one into a media server using jellyfin, I used one of the older ones with a dvd player to get the media files from a dvd collection my family has.
